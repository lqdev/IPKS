# IPKS Access Control & Privacy Specification
**Draft Version 0.1**

## Abstract

This specification defines the access control and privacy framework for the InterPlanetary Knowledge System (IPKS). It details how knowledge nodes implement permissions, encryption, and governance to balance the openness of distributed knowledge with the need for privacy, confidentiality, and controlled collaboration. This specification enables fine-grained access control while preserving the verifiability and integrity inherent in content-addressed systems.

## Status of This Document

This document is a draft specification. It is intended to provide a foundation for implementation and further refinement through community input and experimental deployments.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

Distributed knowledge systems must balance transparency with privacy. While public knowledge benefits from open access, many knowledge contexts require confidentiality, selective disclosure, and governance. IPKS requires mechanisms that maintain the integrity and verifiability of content-addressed knowledge while providing flexible, credential-based access controls.

### 1.2 Relationship to Existing Technologies

This specification builds upon:
- IPFS/IPLD for content-addressed storage
- Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for identity
- Verifiable Credentials for access rights
- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification
- Encrypted data formats and key management systems
- IPKS Core Knowledge Model, Identity, Credentials, and Semantic specifications

### 1.3 Design Goals

- Enable fine-grained access control for Knowledge Nodes
- Support privacy-preserving knowledge sharing
- Allow selective disclosure of knowledge
- Provide mechanisms for knowledge governance
- Enable both decentralized and organization-specific control models
- Preserve the verifiability of knowledge while restricting access

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Access Control

Access Control refers to the policies and mechanisms that restrict access to Knowledge Nodes based on identity, credentials, and context.

### 2.2 Knowledge Space

A Knowledge Space is a defined collection of Knowledge Nodes with shared access control policies and governance structures.

### 2.3 Permission

A Permission is a specific right to perform an operation on a Knowledge Node or within a Knowledge Space.

### 2.4 Governance Model

A Governance Model defines how decisions about access control, content policies, and dispute resolution are made within a Knowledge Space.

## 3. Access Control Model

### 3.1 Permission Types

IPKS defines these core permission types:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| READ | View the content of a Knowledge Node |
| WRITE | Create or modify a Knowledge Node |
| RELATE | Create relationships between Knowledge Nodes |
| MANAGE | Change access control settings |
| DELEGATE | Grant permissions to others |
| REVOKE | Remove permissions from others |

### 3.2 Access Control Lists

Knowledge Nodes and Spaces implement access control through:

```json
"accessControl": {
  "defaultPolicy": "DENY" | "ALLOW",
  "accessControlList": [
    {
      "grantee": "DID or credential requirement",
      "permissions": ["READ", "WRITE", ...],
      "conditions": {
        /* Optional condition expressions */
      },
      "expirationDate": "ISO8601-timestamp"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3.3 Credential-Based Access

Access may be granted based on verified credentials:

```json
"grantee": {
  "type": "VerifiableCredential",
  "credentialType": "ExpertiseCredential",
  "constraints": {
    "knowledgeDomain": "domain-URI",
    "minimumLevel": "level-URI"
  }
}
```

## 4. Privacy Mechanisms

### 4.1 Encryption Models

IPKS supports multiple encryption approaches:

#### 4.1.1 Whole Node Encryption

Encrypting the entire Knowledge Node:
- Content and metadata are encrypted
- K-CID is derived from the encrypted content
- Decryption requires appropriate keys

#### 4.1.2 Partial Encryption

Selective encryption of Knowledge Node components:
- Specific content sections are encrypted
- Metadata remains accessible
- Multiple encryption zones with different keys

#### 4.1.3 Metadata-Only Access

Revealing only structural information:
- Content is encrypted
- Relationships are visible
- Basic metadata is accessible

### 4.2 Key Management

For managing encryption keys:

#### 4.2.1 Direct Key Sharing

Simple key distribution for small groups:
- Symmetric keys encrypted to each recipient's public key
- Key rotation protocols for changing group membership
- Secure key distribution channels

#### 4.2.2 Threshold Cryptography

For collaborative governance:
- M-of-N threshold schemes for key recovery
- Split key management across governance participants
- Shamir's Secret Sharing or similar approaches

#### 4.2.3 Capability-Based Encryption

For flexible delegation:
- Hierarchical key derivation
- Capability tokens for specific operations
- Revocation mechanisms

### 4.3 Zero-Knowledge Techniques

For privacy-preserving verification:
- Zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge possession
- Selective disclosure of credential attributes
- Private set membership proofs

## 5. Knowledge Spaces

### 5.1 Space Definition

A Knowledge Space is defined as:

```json
{
  "spaceId": "unique-space-identifier",
  "name": "Human-readable space name",
  "description": "Space description",
  "created": "ISO8601-timestamp",
  "governance": {
    /* Governance model */
  },
  "accessControl": {
    /* Space-wide access control */
  },
  "knowledgeTypes": [
    /* Allowed knowledge node types */
  ],
  "membershipRequirements": {
    /* Credential requirements for membership */
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Space Membership

Membership in a Knowledge Space may be:
- Open (anyone can join)
- Credential-gated (requires specific verifiable credentials)
- Invitation-only (requires authorization from existing members)
- Hybrid (combines multiple requirements)

### 5.3 Space Governance

Knowledge Spaces support governance models:
- Centralized (single administrator)
- Federation (multiple organizational administrators)
- DAO-like (vote-based decision making)
- Meritocratic (expertise-weighted influence)

## 6. Implementation Models
