# InterPlanetary Knowledge System (IPKS)
**Main Specification - Draft Version 0.1**

## Abstract

The InterPlanetary Knowledge System (IPKS) is a protocol suite that enables the creation, verification, and navigation of distributed knowledge graphs using content-addressed storage. IPKS extends the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD) to support semantically rich, verifiable knowledge with provenance, expertise validation, and governance controls. This main specification provides an overview of IPKS, its design principles, architecture, and the relationship between its component specifications.

## Status of This Document

This document is a draft specification. It is intended to provide a foundation for implementation and further refinement through community input and experimental deployments.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Vision and Purpose

The InterPlanetary Knowledge System (IPKS) envisions a global, decentralized knowledge infrastructure where information can be freely shared, verified, and connected while respecting privacy, attribution, and governance needs. IPKS transforms the document-centric web into an idea-centric internet where knowledge, not just files, becomes the primary unit of organization and retrieval.

IPKS addresses fundamental challenges in knowledge management:

- **Verifiability**: How can we trust the provenance and authenticity of knowledge?
- **Expertise**: How can we validate the qualifications of knowledge contributors?
- **Integration**: How can knowledge from different sources be meaningfully connected?
- **Evolution**: How can knowledge change over time while preserving history?
- **Access**: How can we balance openness with privacy and governance?

By solving these challenges, IPKS enables new paradigms for collaborative knowledge work across organizational, disciplinary, and geographic boundaries.

### 1.2 Design Principles

IPKS is guided by the following core principles:

1. **Knowledge-Centricity**: Knowledge, not documents, is the fundamental unit
2. **Verifiable Provenance**: All knowledge carries cryptographic proof of origin
3. **Semantic Relationships**: Connections between knowledge are explicitly typed
4. **Credential-Based Trust**: Expertise and authority are verified through credentials
5. **Evolvable Structure**: Knowledge can change while maintaining referential integrity
6. **Privacy-Preserving**: Knowledge sharing respects privacy and confidentiality needs
7. **Interoperable Standards**: IPKS builds on and extends existing web standards
8. **Decentralized Operation**: No central authorities control the knowledge infrastructure
9. **Human and Machine Accessibility**: Knowledge is usable by both people and algorithms

### 1.3 Relationship to Existing Technologies

IPKS builds upon several foundational technologies:

- **IPFS** (InterPlanetary File System): Distributed content-addressed storage
- **IPLD** (InterPlanetary Linked Data): Data model for content-addressed linking
- **DIDs** (Decentralized Identifiers): Self-sovereign digital identity
- **VCs** (Verifiable Credentials): Cryptographically verifiable claims
- **RDF/OWL** (Resource Description Framework/Web Ontology Language): Semantic data representation
- **JSON-LD**: JSON-based format for linked data

IPKS extends these technologies with knowledge-specific protocols to create a comprehensive system for distributed knowledge management.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Architectural Overview

IPKS architecture consists of five interconnected layers:

1. **Storage Layer**: Content-addressed persistence based on IPFS
2. **Knowledge Representation Layer**: Structure and addressing for knowledge nodes
3. **Identity & Credentials Layer**: Verification of authors and their qualifications
4. **Semantic Layer**: Relationships and meaning between knowledge entities
5. **Governance Layer**: Access control, privacy, and collaborative management

The IPKS specifications define the protocols and data models for each layer, while permitting multiple implementation approaches.

### 2.2 Core Components

IPKS consists of the following core components:

- **Knowledge Nodes**: Discrete units of knowledge with content, metadata, and relationships
- **Knowledge CIDs (K-CIDs)**: Content identifiers specific to knowledge with version information
- **Semantic Relationships**: Typed connections between knowledge nodes
- **Knowledge Spaces**: Governed collections of knowledge with shared access control
- **Contributor Identities**: DIDs representing knowledge contributors
- **Expertise Credentials**: Verifiable claims about contributor qualifications
- **Ontologies**: Formal definitions of concepts and relationships

These components work together to create a comprehensive system for managing distributed knowledge.

### 2.3 Component Specifications

IPKS is fully defined through a suite of five component specifications:

1. **IPKS Core Knowledge Model**: Defines knowledge nodes, addressing, and operations
2. **IPKS Identity & Authorship**: Specifies integration with DIDs and authorship verification
3. **IPKS Credential Verification**: Details expertise validation and trust frameworks
4. **IPKS Semantic Relationships**: Establishes connection types and knowledge graph navigation
5. **IPKS Access Control & Privacy**: Defines permissions, encryption, and governance

Each specification addresses a distinct aspect of the system while maintaining interoperability with the others.

## 3. Knowledge Nodes

### 3.1 Knowledge Node Concept

The fundamental unit in IPKS is the Knowledge Node - a content-addressed, semantically enriched, verifiable package of information. Knowledge Nodes differ from simple documents or data by incorporating:

- Explicit semantic structure
- Cryptographic authorship verification
- Credential-based expertise validation
- Typed relationships to other knowledge
- Versioning with history preservation
- Access control mechanisms

Knowledge Nodes can represent any type of knowledge, from simple facts to complex domain models, scientific data, business intelligence, educational content, and beyond.

### 3.2 Knowledge CIDs (K-CIDs)

Knowledge is addressed through Knowledge CIDs (K-CIDs), which extend IPLD CIDs with knowledge-specific properties:

- Content hash ensuring integrity
- Codec information for interpretation
- Knowledge version information
- Schema reference (optional)

K-CIDs enable knowledge to be referenced, retrieved, and verified in a distributed environment, forming the foundation of the IPKS addressing system.

### 3.3 Knowledge Operations

IPKS defines standard operations on Knowledge Nodes:

- **Creation**: Generating new Knowledge Nodes with attribution
- **Retrieval**: Fetching Knowledge Nodes by their K-CIDs
- **Relationships**: Connecting Knowledge Nodes with typed relationships
- **Updates**: Creating new versions while preserving history
- **Verification**: Validating authorship and credentials
- **Access Control**: Managing permissions and privacy

These operations form the API for interacting with IPKS implementations.

## 4. Knowledge Graphs

### 4.1 Knowledge Graph Structure

In IPKS, Knowledge Nodes are connected through typed relationships to form Knowledge Graphs. These graphs differ from traditional graphs by having:

- Content-addressed nodes (using K-CIDs)
- Semantically typed edges (with relationship URIs)
- Contributor attribution on both nodes and edges
- Confidence scores for relationships
- Credential-based trust evaluation

Knowledge Graphs can span organizational boundaries while maintaining verifiability and attribution.

### 4.2 Graph Navigation

IPKS Knowledge Graphs support multiple navigation patterns:

- Direct retrieval via K-CID
- Relationship traversal
- Semantic querying
- Multi-hop inference
- History exploration

Navigation can consider relationship types, confidence scores, contributor credentials, and governance boundaries.

### 4.3 Graph Evolution

Unlike static graphs, IPKS Knowledge Graphs evolve over time:

- Nodes can be updated with new versions
- Relationships can be added, modified, or deprecated
- Trust in nodes and relationships can change based on new credentials
- Access permissions can evolve with governance decisions

The system maintains references to prior versions, ensuring continuity and traceability.

## 5. Identity and Credentials

### 5.1 Contributor Identity

IPKS uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to represent knowledge contributors, whether individuals, organizations, or autonomous systems. DIDs provide:

- Cryptographic verification of authorship
- Persistent identity across knowledge contributions
- Platform-independent identification
- Self-sovereign control

Contributors can use different DIDs for different contexts while maintaining a coherent contribution history.

### 5.2 Expertise Validation

Knowledge contributions gain trust through Verifiable Credentials that establish expertise and authority:

- Academic credentials verify educational qualifications
- Professional credentials verify work experience
- Domain expertise credentials verify subject matter knowledge
- Organizational credentials verify institutional affiliation

These credentials are cryptographically verifiable and can be selectively disclosed to balance transparency with privacy.

### 5.3 Trust Frameworks

IPKS supports multiple trust models:

- Credential-based trust (validating expertise claims)
- Web-of-trust (social verification)
- Institutional trust (recognized authorities)
- Reputation systems (based on contribution history)
- Consensus mechanisms (multi-party verification)

Different knowledge domains can implement appropriate trust frameworks while maintaining interoperability.

## 6. Privacy and Governance

### 6.1 Access Control

IPKS balances openness with privacy through flexible access controls:

- Public knowledge is available to all
- Private knowledge uses encryption for confidentiality
- Credential-gated knowledge requires specific verifiable credentials
- Role-based access controls permission specific operations
- Contextual access depends on usage purpose

These controls apply at both individual Knowledge Node and Knowledge Space levels.

### 6.2 Knowledge Spaces

Knowledge Spaces provide governance boundaries for collections of Knowledge Nodes:

- Defined membership requirements
- Shared access control policies
- Collective decision-making processes
- Domain-specific relationship types
- Common trust frameworks

Spaces can represent organizations, communities of practice, projects, or other collaborative contexts.

### 6.3 Cross-Space Interaction

IPKS enables knowledge to flow across governance boundaries through:

- Knowledge bridges (explicit connection points)
- Federation protocols (coordinated but autonomous spaces)
- Citation mechanisms (referencing without exposing)
- Credential recognition (cross-boundary expertise validation)

These mechanisms preserve governance autonomy while enabling broader knowledge integration.

## 7. Use Cases

### 7.1 Supply Chain Intelligence

IPKS enables transparent, verified supply chain knowledge:

- Material provenance with cryptographic verification
- Component quality data with expertise credentials
- Regulatory compliance with authority verification

This creates a unified knowledge graph across multiple organizations while respecting proprietary boundaries.

### 7.2 Collaborative Research

Scientific collaboration benefits from IPKS through:

- Verified authorship of research findings
- Credential validation for domain expertise
- Semantic relationships between research components
- Versioned evolution of scientific understanding
- Selective sharing of preliminary results

The system supports both open science and proprietary research models.

### 7.3 Business Intelligence

Organizations use IPKS for enhanced business intelligence:

- Cross-departmental knowledge integration
